--README--
...description comes here...

You need ncurses to be able to compile and use this thing. Not just curses.
Sorry..

The executables installed are smsg, rchat and smsgwho. Smsg is the main
executable, read the manual for more information.
rchat is a script which, with help from smsgwho 'emulates' room support. The
script works by starting a server on a different port for every room. Problem is
that it should be set suid/sgid to its own group to have the rooms/servers
accessible to everyone.

The smsg server suffers from the same problem, if someone happens to find an
exploit that person should not get root. To get rid of this problem create a
user and group and set smsg suid/sgid to them. ...blahblahblah...that should be
automated.

--INSTALL--
To compile and install this program you need a make program compatible with
either gnu make or bsd make. In case you do not have such a program try the
makeme.sh script. The script is not as nice as the makefiles but it should at
least compile a correct executable.

By default everything is installed under /usr/local, change config.mk if you
want it somewhere else.

Anyway, do these things to compile and install:
 1. run './config.sh' to configure some options etc.
    This script is quite dumb so it might fail miserably. (Please inform me if
    it does!)
 2. check config.mk and change things if it doesn't suit your needs
 3. run 'make'; if you get an error about ncurses, first make sure you -have-
    ncurses, then find out where it is and put the prefix after
    'NCURSES_PREFIX=' in config.mk. Example: run 'whereis ncurses' and take the
    prefix from the ncurses.h file (so /usr/pkg/include/ncurses.h leads
    to /usr/pkg). Then place that in config.mk and rerun make.
 4. run 'make install' to install these files:
    - $prefix/bin/smsg, $prefix/bin/rchat and $prefix/bin/smsgwho
    - $prefix/share/man/man1/smsg.1
    - $prefix/var/rc-smsg (a directory)
