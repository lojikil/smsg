This is what I remember having used/'leant' code from/etc. to make this program:

Beej's guide to socket programming (where I learned the whole socket thing from...nice tutorial)
the BitchX interface
the terminal resize code from lmme (nice prog...but lacks some iface touches and stability)
various programs/(OS) header files/documents I used to figure out how to do things
